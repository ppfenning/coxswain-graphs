    """Ask the policy which proposals have earned the right to skip the gate.

    THE CALLER FILTERS. `autonomy_policy` refuses rows spanning more than one
    configuration rather than averaging across them, so the filter here is not a
    nicety — it is the precondition that makes the question answerable at all.
    `provider_profile` narrows every row up front, one value for the whole
    call. `model` narrows per item instead, because a batch of proposals can
    carry different bindings; a row recorded under a different model is not
    this item's streak any more than a row from a different cartridge is.

    Note what an auto-applied proposal does NOT get: a ledger row. The ledger
    records what happened at the gate, and an auto-apply never reached one. If
    acting on a streak could extend that streak, a kind would ratchet itself up
    forever on its own say-so, which is the exact self-report the ledger exists
    to disbelieve. Autonomy is spent by acting, and only re-earned at the gate —
    or lost when a detector files an observation against it.

    THE POLICY IS ASKED AT THE GRAIN THE PROPOSAL NAMES. A proposal that carries
    a `subject` — the runbook entry a `doc_update` amends, say — has its streak
    read over that entry's own rows and no others. The entry, not the category,
    is what earned or lost the trust: `doc_update` is a container, and forty
    good entries averaging over one that is wrong every time it fires is exactly
    the case the ledger exists to surface. A proposal carrying `subject_new`
    creates its subject, so it can never ride the kind's streak — there is no
    track record for something that does not exist yet, and creation is the
    moment a wrong entry is cheapest to catch.

    Absence is passed through as absence. A proposal with no subject gets the
    kind-level reading, which counts every row whatever subject it carries — the
    strict direction, and the only one that keeps the fallback honest. Writing a
    default subject here would invent a track record; the policy would then be
    answering a question nobody asked.

    Caps stay keyed per kind. `applied_this_run` bounds how much of a kind may
    land in one run, which is a question about blast radius, not about which
    entry earned what.
