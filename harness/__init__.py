"""The harness: the runtime that owns consequences.

Four nouns, one seam each:

    harness    side effects, policy, the gate, the ledger — THIS package
    graph      a program the harness runs; owns sequence, writes nothing
    cartridge  domain configuration: role -> skill, where writes land
    runner     execution backend: scripted in tests, the Messages API live

A graph is `run(args, runner) -> dict` and registers itself by declaring a
`SPEC`; the harness discovers it, obtains its inputs, runs it, splits its
proposals by the autonomy policy, gates what has not earned autonomy, applies
what was approved through the arm the cartridge names, and records the run.
Graphs stay pure because this package is not. That is the trade, and it is
deliberate: everything worth unit-testing lives on the other side of it.
