"""The live runner: role + tier in, structured output out.

This is the only module in either repo that imports a vendor SDK, and the only
one that reads an environment variable or a file. Everything else — every graph,
every policy decision — is pure and testable without it. That is not an accident
of layering; it is the reason the substrate can change providers by editing one
YAML file.

Two indirections are resolved here and nowhere else:

    tier  -> model       from the provider profile
    role  -> skill body  from the cartridge's bindings, handed in by the harness

The provider profile names an env var for the key. It never carries the value,
and neither does any cartridge, graph, or test fixture.
