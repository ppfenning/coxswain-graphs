"""A runner that returns canned answers, so a whole graph is testable offline.

This is not a mock in the apologetic sense — it is the reason the graphs can be
tested at all. Every node in this system is a model call, and a test suite that
needs a network and a key to run is a test suite nobody runs in CI.

It is also deliberately strict. A scripted runner that invented a plausible
answer for a node the test forgot to script would let a graph change shape
without any test noticing.
